Online tuner software, based on web audio API: [https://hasanbahadirkoca.com/tuner](https://hasanbahadirkoca.com/tuner).

I added a simple logo to [Qiuxiang](https://github.com/qiuxiang/tuner)'s project and plus and minus signs that turn green when the sound is correct, and red when the sound is false. At the same time, the indicator bar turns green when the sound is correct.

You can find this version of the project on my [website](https://hasanbahadirkoca.com/tuner).

Best regards to [qiuxiang](https://github.com/qiuxiang).
